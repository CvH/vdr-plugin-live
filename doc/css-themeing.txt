How to do live theming with CSS.
================================

Live supports CSS theming. While the structure of the html pages is
given by the plugin, there is the possibility to change the look
through CSS.

Currently a predefined, compiled into the plugin stylesheet 'styles.css' is
delivered first. Then a stylesheet 'css/siteprefs.css' is sent to the
browser. 'css/siteprefs.css' is a normal file that is found in
USRDIR. The default of USRDIR is /usr/share/vdr-plugin-live. This
can be changed at compile time by setting the USRDIR variable
(i.E. USRDIR=/tmp/live make)

One of the next steps will be a mechanism to select additional style
files and images through a theme setting in vdr. The different themes
will be also located in theme related subdirs beneath USRDIR.

If you created a nice new look, you can provide it to us. We will try
to include it into the live distribution.
