This file contains some guidlines for developers about what to obey
when adding new functionality to live plugin.

First of all please look at the existing code and how it was done
there. We are still open for improvement suggestions though.

We want to support a broad range of browsers. On one side are hand held
devices like WEB-enabled PDAs or mobile phones. They often lack full
grown support for ECMAScript and have small screen sizes. The other
extreme are the desktop browsers like FireFox, Konqueror, Opera and
perhabs IE (if the 'powers that be' make him more CSS compliant).
Here WEB 2.0 featuers can improve the users experience.

In the future some themeing in live might help to cover this broad
range. Meanwhile we suggest the following rule to activate
functionality with and without ECMAScript support:

Use anchors analog to this example

 <a href="show_content.html?ref=additional_content_ref"
 onclick="makefalse(requestbox('additional_content_ref'));">link</a>

to retrieve and display extra information either in a WEB 2.0 fashion
in an popup box or on a separte page in a html fashion.
