Description:
============

Live, the "Live Interactive VDR Environment", is a plugin providing the
possibility to interactivly control the VDR and some of it's plugins by
a web interface.

Unlike external utility programs that communicate with VDR and it's plugins
by SVDRP, Live has direct access to VDR's data structures and is thus very
fast.



Requirements:
=============

Tntnet >= 1.5.3		- http://www.tntnet.org/download.hms
Cxxtools >= 1.4.3	- http://www.tntnet.org/download.hms
boost >= 1.32.0		- http://www.boost.org

Tntnet provides basic webserver functions for live and needs cxxtools.
Boost provides some data structures we need. While currently relying on the
full blown package we might provide a stripped down version in the future.



So how does it work?
====================
Basically, Live itself is a Tntnet webserver integrated into the plugin
structure VDR needs.
This webserver, running in VDR's environment, is provided it with all public data
structures VDR provides for plugins and thus has very fast access to
information like the EPG, timers or recordings.

Live's "pages" are written in "ecpp", a language integrating C++ and HTML in
one file, very much like e.g. PHP or ASP weave functionality and "static"
content information together.
