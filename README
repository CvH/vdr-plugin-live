Description:
============

Live, the "Live Interactive VDR Environment", is a plugin providing the
possibility to interactively control the VDR and some of it's plugins by
a web interface.

Unlike external utility programs that communicate with VDR and it's plugins
by SVDRP, Live has direct access to VDR's data structures and is thus very
fast.



Requirements:
=============

VDR >= 1.4.0-2
Tntnet >= 1.5.3		- http://www.tntnet.org/download.hms
Cxxtools >= 1.4.3	- http://www.tntnet.org/download.hms
gcc >= 3.1

if gcc < 4.0:
boost >= 1.32.0		- http://www.boost.org 


Tntnet provides basic webserver functions for live and needs cxxtools.
Boost provides some data structures we need. While currently relying on the
full blown package we might provide a stripped down version in the future.



Setup
=====

Live provides a username/password protection, so that it can be used from
the internet. The default username and password are:

	admin/live

The default port is 8008.

You can also specifiy this parameter via commandline:

  -p PORT,  --port=PORT     use PORT to listen for incoming connections
                            (default: 8008)
  -i IP,    --ip=IP         bind server only to specified IP, may appear
                            multiple times
                            (default: 0.0.0.0)

The rest of the parameters can be adjusted in VDR's OSD or in the web
interface.

The password is stored as a MD5 hash.
"Last Channel" is the last channel in the channels list, that live displays.
This is especially useful if you have VDR's automatic channel update active.
For example, you can add a group seperator ":@1000 Found automatically" to
channels.conf an set this parameter to "1000". Thus, everything VDR finds
during scanning (which can after a few months be well more than 3000
channels) won't be displayed.



So how does it work?
====================
Basically, Live itself is a Tntnet webserver integrated into the plugin
structure VDR needs.
This webserver, running in VDR's environment, is provided with all public data
structures VDR provides for plugins and thus has very fast access to
information like the EPG, timers or recordings.

Live's "pages" are written in "ecpp", a language integrating C++ and HTML in
one file, very much like e.g. PHP or ASP weave functionality and "static"
content information together.
